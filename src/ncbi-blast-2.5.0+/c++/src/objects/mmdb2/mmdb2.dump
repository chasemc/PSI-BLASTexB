T,87,Biostruc-model,SEQUENCE
-- A structural model maps chemical components into a measured three-
-- dimensional space. PDB-derived biostrucs generally contain 4 models, 
-- corresponding to "views" of the structure of a biomolecular assemble with 
-- increasing levels of complexity.  Model types indicate the complexity of the
-- view.  
-- The model named "NCBI all atom" represents a view suitable for most 
-- computational biology applications.  It provides complete atomic coordinate 
-- data for a "single best" model, omitting statistical disorder information 
-- and/or ensemble structure descriptions provided in the source PDB file.  
-- Construction of the single best model is based on the assumption that the 
-- contents of the "alternate conformation" field from pdb imply no correlation
-- among the occupancies of multiple sites assigned to sets of atoms: the best 
-- site is chosen only on the basis of highest occupancy. Note, however, that 
-- alternate conformation sets where correlation is implied are generally 
-- constrained in crystallographic refinement to have uniform occupancy, and 
-- will thus be selected as a set. For ensemble models the model which assigns 
-- coordinates to the most atoms is chosen.  If numbers of coordinates are the 
-- same, the model occurring first in the PDB file is selected.  The single 
-- best model includes complete coordinates for all nonpolymer components, but 
-- omits those classified as "solvent".  Model type is 3 for this model. 
-- The model named "NCBI backbone" represents a simple view intended for 
-- graphic displays and rapid transmission over a network.  It includes only 
-- alpha carbon or backbone phosphate coordinates for biopolymers. It is based 
-- on selection of alpha-carbon and backbone phosphate atoms from the "NCBI
-- all atom" model. The model type is set to 2.  An even simpler model gives 
-- only a cartoon representation, using cylinders corresponding to secondary 
-- structure elements.  This is named "NCBI vector", and has model type 1.
-- The models named "PDB Model 1", "PDB Model 2", etc. represent the complete
-- information provided by PDB, including full descriptions of statistical
-- disorder.  The name of the model is based on the contents of the PDB MODEL
-- record, with a default name of "PDB Model 1" for PDB files which contain 
-- only a single model.  Construction of these models is based on the 
-- assumption that contents of the PDB "alternate conformation" field are 
-- intended to imply correlation among the occupancies of atom sets flagged by
-- the same identifier.  The special flag " " (blank) is assumed to indicate 
-- sites occupied in all alternate conformations, and sites flagged otherwise,
-- together with " ", to indicate a distinct member of an ensemble of 
-- alternate conformations.  Note that construction of ensemble members 
-- according to these assumption requires two validation checks on PDB 
-- "alternate conformation" flags: they must be unique among sites assigned to 
-- the same atom, and that the special " " flag must occur only for unique
-- sites.  Sites which violate the first check are flagged as "u", for 
-- "unknown"; they are omitted from all ensemble definitions but are 
-- nontheless retained in the coordinate list.  Sites which violate the second
-- check are flagged "b" for "blank", and are included in an appropriately
-- named ensemble.  The model type for pdb all models is 4.
-- Note that in the MMDB database models are stored in the ASN.1 stream in
-- order of increasing model type value.  Since models occur as the last item
-- in a biostruc, parsers may avoid reading the entire stream if the desired
-- model is one of the simplified types, which occur first in the stream. This
-- can save considerable I/O time, particularly for large ensemble models from 
-- NMR determinations.

-- distinguish between correlated and uncorrelated disorder in crystallographic
-- models. Ensembles identified in MMDB thus may not correspond to the meaning
-- intended by PDB or the depositor.  No information is lost, however, and
-- if the intended meaning is known alternative ensemble descriptions may be
